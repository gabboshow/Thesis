\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
Nowadays, almost no research project is the result of one single person's work in complete isolation. This research is no exception and first I would like to thank the many individuals of the CQT group who have been helpful in achieving the results described here. I am very thankful to Edgar Vredenbregt and his daily supervision. Edgar, \textit{you are a very bright scientist both in theoretical and experimental contents.} Also my promoter Jom Luiten and my second co-promotor Peter Mutsaers were essential for completing the project on time: providing corrections, ideas and useful discussions.\\ 
A very special mention goes to the technicians: Jolanda van de Ven, Ad Kemper, Wim Kemper, Louis van Moll, Eddie Rietman, Iman Koole and Harry van Doorn. Without your contribution in designing and building electrical/mechanical components, I probably would have taken double the time to complete the PhD. \textit{You are an essential part of our group and I am really grateful to have worked with you.}\\ 
Merijn Reijnders and Gabriel Taban worked on the setup before me and they were of huge help in the beginning of the PhD, sharing their large experience with me. Bas van der Geer helped me a lot with the simulations and I have enjoyed discussing together.\\ 
My master students, Roland van Vliembergen and Remy Notermans, and my stagers, This Clevis and Kees Hermans, all gave a great contribution. It has been fun to supervise you to the point you became independent scientists, \textit{I wish you all the luck in continuing your career in science.}\\
Marnix van der Wiel, I will never be grateful enough for helping me to find a place in the group and strongly want me to work here. Betty Eversdijk has been very important, not only in administrating the group, you have always encouraged me on developing my creative skills too, namely photography (\textit{and you own the first Dobermani Production print, one day it will be worth something..maybe..}).\\
My office mates: Thijs \textit{``info-sponge''} Meijer (\textit{thx for the candies!}), Stefan \textit{``caffeine''} Voeten (\textit{always keep your enthusiasm in everything you do}), Adam \textit{``l'Americano''} Lassise (\textit{I will never forget our trip in US and the hospitality of your family}), Wouter Engelen (\textit{our trip to Australia was awesome!}), Rick \textit{``matlab''} van Bijnen and Xavier \textit{``de Belgie''} Stragier (\textit{how many beers we had together!}). You were more than colleagues, I consider you my friends as well. The best memories are group outings, CQT beer nights, promotion parties and conference trips. It was nice to have spent time with all of my (ex-)colleagues: Ton van Leeuwen, Peter Smoreburg, Jaap Corstens, Seth Brussaard, Servaas Kokkelmans, Corine Fabrie, Simon Bell, Stefano Dal Conte (\textit{buona fortuna in Olanda!}), Bas Fleskens, Erwin de Jong, Peter Pasmans, Maikel Goosen, Willem op 't Root, Thijs van Oudheusden, David Kusters, Marieke de Loos, Josh Beardmore, Rob Scholten (\textit{see you maybe in Australia at some point?}).\\

Eindhoven is not an easy environment to live in without friends. Nevertheless, it is a place I have learnt to love and is the city where I want to continue living. Therefore, at second, I would like to greet the people who made my life much nicer. I am very happy to be part of the ``Italian family'' here in Eindhoven, which is made up of my housemates and neighbors (current and former). Marco, we have started the PhD at the same time and it has been nice to live together with you for 4 years. I wish you a wonderful future career and good luck with your new job! \textit{Dai Marco Dai!} Ciccio, there is not a minute I have not enjoyed while being with you, \textit{spero che tu possa realizzare il tuo sogno e diventare il ballerino di tip-tap piu' famoso del mondo.} Terence, after 3 years we spent together in Eindhoven I miss you man. You are my manager and you know what else..! \textit{E sei anche il Francese piu' italianizzato che conosca!} Serena, \textit{ti auguro di finire bene il dottorato e di riunirti al piu' presto con il tuo amore.} Ginny, \textit{viva la totta e la ballotta!} Dani, please stop getting injured playing soccer and come to skate more often! \textit{Guarda che lo dico al nostro maestro!} Agnese, we met in Eindhoven, 1000 km away from our birth places which are only 30 km apart.. \textit{ora me la merito una pizza per questa tesi? me la porti?} Christian, \textit{sei l'ultimo arrivato e ora che ho un po' piu' di tempo sarai la vittima preferita dei miei bullismi} and Beppe (\textit{dai, c***o!})\\
All the other friends I met in Eindhoven during the years, among them: Francesca \& Vinnie, Manu \& Valerio (\textit{dai, anche Panino}), Nellie \& Anton (\textit{mijn Nederlandse Mama \& Papa}), Luca (\textit{la persona che ha preso piu' aerei nel mondo}), Rossella, Simonetta (\textit{quando vieni a cucinare gli ``star male'' di nuovo?}), Mike (\textit{grazie per l'eventuale tessera}), Greg (\textit{it was special to meet you in Australia! I hope we will live on the same continent sooner or later..}), Nacho \textit{``business man''} Corleone Ibasor, Mario \textit{``Mister X''}, Lucia \textit{``indie''}, Emilio \textit{``macho man''}, Vincenzo (\textit{avrei bisogno di una nuova scivania..}) and many more!\\
During the last years I have also discovered my passion for skateboarding and many thanks go to my teacher Wouter (\textit{fast and loose!}), Simon (\textit{who made my first photo-expo possible!}) and the Area Fiftyone skatepark crew in Eindhoven.\\

My long time forever Italian friends, who are spread around the world but are always in my heart: Maxi \textit{``spanato''}, Pippo \textit{``El Cerdi''}, \textit{``zio''} Ettore \& \textit{``zia''} Ilaria, \textit{``nonno''} Ermi, Anna \& Gulli (\textit{tutto il bene del mondo per la vostra nuova famiglia!}), Dando, Jason, Luca, Fede (\textit{forza Juve!}), Selena (\textit{me lo fai un bagel?}), Lele \& family, Giana, Maphia, Valerio, inoToni, Gianosk8, and the Biella sk8 crew. \textit{Non ci vediamo spesso, ma ogni volta e` come se il tempo non fosse passato e per me siete importantissimi, anche se lontani. Vi voglio bene!}\\

My family, who always supports me: Lella, Federico, Andrea, Arabella, Angelo and Andreino, Laura \& Luciano. \textit{E' sempre bello tornare in Italia per incontrarvi! Mi mancate e grazie per essermi sempre stati vicino e per essere venuti spesso a trovarmi qui in Olanda.}\\

At last but not least, I could not have done it without my lovely Ester, the sweetest and most beautiful girl I ever met. You are also the reason why I came to do a PhD in the Netherlands, so without you, I would not have probably reached this goal. Thank you for helping, encouraging and supporting me all this long time! We have been up and down, together and separate for seven years, I am curious to know what the future will reserve for us.. $\heartsuit$~\textit{Comunque vada, ti amo e ti amero' per sempre}~$\heartsuit$\\

To all those people I mentioned before and the ones I forgot, you know who you are,
