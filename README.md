To do list:
  Thorax rejection:
    Read paper.
    Read reviewers comment and address point by point.

    Differentiate between inhaled medication clinical trials and rehabilitation studies (ask Rafael to separate).
    Stratify according region, season, pharmacologic intervention, rehabilitation,
    Why a more detailed PA analysis in COPD is clinically important?
    Include step count in the analysis.
    Exercise intensity was quantified using METS as detailed by ACSM. This is likely the best available approach to quantify intensity; however, 
    It is worth noting in the limitations section that these cut-offs do not take into consideration the individual patient’s peak METS, 
    which likely varies considerably across the cohort of COPD patients. Introduce max peak METS.
    Use data that include only 6MWDT.
    Assess stability of a patient within a cluster. How to define?
    Include heatlhy in cluster analysis.
    Principle component analysis was limited to 3 factors as this allows visual display. 
    Are there statistical arguments that 2 or 4 factors are not better (i.e. explain respectively much less (2 factorss) and not more (4 factors)) variance?
    
  ADL test:
    v Test resetting gyro.
    v Do not use gyro.
    v Test to be used with the first patient.
      Transfer data to computer using shimmer.
    
  Smartscope:
    Take 1 datastream, doesnt matter which one.
    Read the paper of Moussavi.
    Implement his method.
    Define metrics.
    
  Topic models:
    Run code only with night.
    Separate physiological variables.
    See what happen.
